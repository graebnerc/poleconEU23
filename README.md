This is the data and code used to replicate all figures for the chapter
[Development models in the EU: opportunities and challenges]()
published in the book [The political economy of Italy]().

All data has been downloaded from openly accessible data bases using the code
`R/get_data.R` (executed on June 21, 2023). The original data is stored
in `data/` (except `eurostat_nuts2_ready.csv`, which must be re-created
using the corresponding parts of `R/get_data.R`).
